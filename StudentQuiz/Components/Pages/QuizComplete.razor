<!-- 
    This page displays a completion message after a student finishes a quiz or attendance check.
    If the quiz involved no questions (when CorrectAnswers and QuizCount are both 0),
    it simply thanks the student for their participation. Otherwise, it shows a brief
    result summary of how many questions were answered correctly.
